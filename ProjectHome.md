Salopp is a very simple protocol to announce and call web server scripts. It is based on XML and JSON.

Salopp is particularly useful in situations where multiple implementations of a particular service exist. It can then be used to introduce an aditional abstraction layer between the caller and the web service.

For a very short introduction, please see the [Introduction to Salopp](Introduction.md).
